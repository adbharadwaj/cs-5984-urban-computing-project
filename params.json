In this\r\nproject, we apply data science techniques to characterize and predict crime in the city of Chicago. We aim to develop a model that predicts crime for a given location and on a future date, when information such as the presence of nearby restaurants and police stations, historical weather and historical crime data is known. We first perform a qualitative analysis of crimes that were reported in the year 2006, and later present a binary classification problem that determines whether a particular area is susceptible to a crime event or not. We develop this model using different supervised machine learning algorithms like k-Nearest Neighbor, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression and Random Forest. We evaluate each of these method under training data-sets of different size. \\textbf{Our model evaluation shows that on average, K-NN performs the best, predicting with an f1-score of 0.92 but Random Forest classifier predicts with the highest recall of 0.99}.\r\n\r\n## Download Data\r\n\r\n- <a href=\"https://github.com/adbharadwaj/cs-5984-urban-computing-project/blob/master/data/Average_Daily_Traffic_Counts_Chicago.csv\">Police Data</a>\r\n- <a href=\"https://github.com/adbharadwaj/cs-5984-urban-computing-project/blob/master/data/Yelp.csv\">Yelp Data</a>\r\n- <a href=\"https://github.com/adbharadwaj/cs-5984-urban-computing-project/blob/master/data/Police.csv\"> Police Station Data</a>\r\n- <a href=\"https://github.com/adbharadwaj/cs-5984-urban-computing-project/blob/master/data/Average_Daily_Traffic_Counts_Chicago.csv\">Traffic Data</a>\r\n",
